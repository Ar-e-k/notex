\end{section}

\begin{section}{Introduction}

  The primary modivation of Galois Theory is to show that there is no general
  solution for polynomials of degree 5 or higher that can be \textbf{solved by
  radicals}. It can also be used to find can a particular given equasion can be
  \textbf{solved in radicals} as well as find the algorithm to find such
  solution (which in practice can be extremely complicated).

  \begin{subsection}{Cubics over \(\mathbb{C}\)}

    To find a general solution to an equation
    \(x^{3} + a_{2}x^{2} + a_{1}x + a_{0} = 0\) a substitution
    \(t = x + \frac{a_{2}}{3}\) can be used to eliminate the \(x^{2}\) term
    leading to \[t^{3} + pt + q\] where p and q can be expressed in terms of
    \(a_{2}, a_{1}, a_{0}\), namely \(p = \frac{-a^{2}_{2} + 3a_{1}}{3}\) and
    \(q = \frac{2a^{3}_{2} -9a_{1}a_{2} + 27a_{0}}{27}\). The new equation is
    called a \textbf{reduced} or \textbf{depressed} cubic. Next step is to do a
    substituton of \(p = -3uv\) and \(q = -(u^{3} + v^{3})\). This u and v also
    give a solution \(u + v\) to the \textbf{reduced} cubic. Starting from a
    quodriatic with roots \(u^{3}, v^{2}\), namely
    \((y - u^{3})(y - v^{3}) = 0\) it can be proceesed through the quodratic
    formula
    that \[u^{3}, v^{3} = -\frac{q}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{q^{2}}{4}} - \frac{p^{3}}{27}\],
    which helps optain a solution to the original equation by optaining the
    solutions in t, \(t = u + v\) and substituting back to x. The other two
    solutions can be obtained by multiplying either u or v by
    \(\omega = e^{\frac{2\pi i}{3}}\) and \(\omega^{2}\), (two other results for
    \(x^{3} = 1\)). The pairs of results are
    \(u + v, \omega u + \omega^{2} w, \omega^{2} u + \omega w\).

    The same formulas will give \textbf{solutions in radicals} in other fields
    \(\mathbb{F}_{p}\) for p prime and \(p \geq 5\). They fail for \(p = 2, 3\)
    as they involve divisibily by 2 and 3.

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Quortic over \(\mathbb{C}\)}

    Similarly to a cubic, any given quortic can be changed to a
    \textbf{reduced} form \(t^{4} + pt^{2} + qt + r = 0\). To solve this, it is
    manipulated to obtain a difference (or sum, identical over \(\mathbb{C}\))
    of two squares. This transforms the quortic into two quodritics, each
    containing two anwsers. This can be always achived by introducing a w term
    to get the following equation
    \[(t + w){}^{2} + (p - 2w)t^{2} + qt + (r - w^{2}) = 0\]
    As \((t + w){}^{2}\) is a square for all w (obvious), we need to ensure the
    other part of the equation is also a square. As it is a quodratic, being a
    square implies that it has a repeted root, therefor its determinant is 0.
    Working through the determinant results in the following cubic
    \[w^{3} - \frac{1}{2}pw^{2} - rw + \frac{1}{8}(4pr - q^{2}) = 0\] which
    solved will give an appropriate w and is called the \textbf{cubic resolvent}.
    Only one anwser needs to be obtained from this cubic as the two quodratics
    contain all the anwsers.

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Symmetris}

    One good example of symetries in quodratic roots are complex roots comming
    in conjugate pairs. Another one is very similar, namely real roots come in
    conjugate pairs similar to complex ones if they are structured over
    \(\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt[2]{n}]\) (with n the determinant). Both of these examples
    can be deduced from the quodratic formula.

  \end{subsection}

\begin{section}{Fields}

  \begin{subsection}{Characteristic}

    For a ring homomorphism \(x: \mathbb{Z} \to K\) with K a field and
    \(x: n \to 1_{0} + 1_{1} + \cdots + 1_{n}\), the  \textbf{characteristic}
    of K (\(char(K)\)) is defined as the smalles \(n \geq 1\) s.t. \(x(n) = 0\)
    if such n exists, otherwise \(char(K) = 0\). \\
    \textit{The characteristic of a field is alsways 0 or prime}

    Iff \(char(K) = 0\) then \(\mathbb{Q}\) is the \textbf{prime subfield} of
    K. \\
    Iff \(char(K) = p\) then \(F_{p}\) is the \textbf{prime subfield} of K.

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Polynomials over Fields}

    For a field K, \(K[x]\) is a ring of polynomials over K,
    \[K[x] = \{a_{0} + a_{1}x + \cdots + a_{n}x_{n} | a_{i} \in K\}{}\]

    \textit{This ring is very similar to \(\mathbb{Z}\)}. It is an integral
    domain as well as an unique factorisation domain.

    \begin{subsubsection}{Irreducibility}

      \textbf{Rational Root Test}: for \(f(x) = a_{n}x^{n} + \cdots + a_{1}x
      + a_{0}\) for all \(a_{i} \in \mathbb{Z}\), if \(f(x)\) has roots in
      \(\frac{b}{c} \in \mathbb{Q}\) then \(b | a_{0}\) and \(c | a_{n}\).

      \textbf{Gauss's Lemma}: suppose \(f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]\) factorises as
      \(f(x) = g(x)h(x)\) where \(g(x), h(x) \in \mathbb{Q}[x]\) then \(\exists r
      \in \mathbb{Q}\) s.t.\ \(rg(x), r^{-1}h(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]\). In other
      words, if \(f(x)\) can be factorised in \(\mathbb{Q}\) it also has to be
      factorised in \(\mathbb{Z}\).

      For a map \(\phi: \mathbb{Z} \to F_{p}[x]\), \(f(x) \to \bar{f}(x) =
      f(x) \pmod{p}\), if \(\bar{f}(x)\) is irreducible in \(F_{p}[x]\), then
      \(f(x)\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Q}[x]\). This is valid as long as
      p is prime and \(p \nmid a_{n}\). This only goes one way.

      \textit{All of this will work if \(\mathbb{Z}\) is replaced with any ring
        R as long as R is a UFD and \(\mathbb{Q}\) with field of fractions
        \(K = Frac(R)\).}

      \textbf{Eisteins' Criterion}: if \(f(x) = a_{n}x^{n} + \cdots a_{1}x +
      a_{0} \in \mathbb{Z}[x]\) and prime p s.t./ \(p \nmid a_{n}\),
      \(p | a_{n - 1}, \dots p | a_{1}\) and \(p | a_{0}\) but \(p^{2} \nmid
      a_{0}\) then \(f(x)\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Q}\).

      \textit{To generalise Eisteins to more rings, p has to be prime in R.}

    \end{subsubsection}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Field Extensions}

    \textit{For a field extension \(L / K\) we generally use Roman letters for
      elements in K and Greek letters for elements in L}.

    \textit{Note: Segment similar to Number Theory (slightly later in hte
      term)}.

    A \textbf{field extension}, denoted \(L / K\) is a field L containing a
    subfield K. Despite the notation, this is not a quotient. \\
    A \textbf{simple field extension} is a field extension such that
    \(L = K(x)\), meaning \(L = \{a_{0} + a_{1}x_{1} + \cdots + a_{n}x_{n}
    | a_{i} \in K\}{}\) and \(x_{i}\) are specific elements in L. Generally
    most field extensions are \textbf{simple}. One of the most important things
    about \textbf{field extensions} is how they map between each other.

    For \(S \subset L\) and \(L / K\), \(K(S)\) is called a \textbf{minimal
      subfield} of L that contains both K and S, also called \textbf{K with
      S adjoined}.

    \begin{subsubsection}{Towers of Field Extensions}

      In Galois Theory, towers \(K \subset M \subset L\) s.t.\ K and F are
      fixed and M varies in between are important. One example is \(K =
      \mathbb{Q}\), \(L = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{7})\) and M is either
      \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}), \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7}), \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{14})\).
      This can be represented with a diagram
      \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}

          \node (Q1) at (0,0) {\(\mathbb{Q}\)};
          \node (Q2) at (2,2) {\(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\)};
          \node (Q3) at (0,4) {\(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{7})\)};
          \node (Q4) at (-2,2) {\(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7})\)};
          \node (Q5) at (0, 2) {\(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{14})\)};

          % To add text x:
          % node [pos=0.7, below,inner sep=0.25cm] {};
          \draw (Q1)--(Q2);
          \draw (Q1)--(Q4);
          \draw (Q3)--(Q4);
          \draw (Q2)--(Q3);
          \draw (Q1)--(Q5);
          \draw (Q3)--(Q5);

        \end{tikzpicture}
      \end{center}
      \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{7}) / \mathbb{Q}\) is also a
      \textbf{simple extension} as it can be writen as \(\mathbb{Q}()\).

    \end{subsubsection}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Algebraic Elements}

    For a field extension \(L / K\) and \(\theta \in L\), \(\theta\) is called
    \textbf{algebraic} if there exists a non-zero polynomial \(f(x) \in K[x]\)
    s.t.\ \(f(\theta) = 0\), otherwise it is called \textbf{transcendental
      over} K. \\
    \textit{For a field \(K(t)\), t is always \textbf{transcendental} over K}.

    Furthermore for the same field extention and element \(\theta \in L\),
    \[I_{K}(\theta) = \{f(x) \in K[x] | f(\theta) = 0\}.\] This makes
    \(I_{K}(\theta)\) a subset of all polynomials in K for which \(\theta\) is
    a root. This subfield is clearly \(\{ 0 \}\) if \(\theta\)
    \textbf{transcendental}. On the other hand, if \(\theta\) is
    \textbf{agebraic}, \(\exists m(x) \in K[x]\) which generates the subset.
    This \(m(x)\) is unique, irreducible and monic in \(K[x]\). This subset is
    an \textbf{ideal} in \(K[x]\). \\
    The polynomial \(m(x)\) is called the minimal polynomial of \(\theta\), and
    the degree of \(\theta = \deg m(x)\). As \(m(x)\) generates the ideal, it
    is the only irreducible element of it. This means that any irreducible
    monic polynomial is a minimal polynomial for all its roots.

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Constructing Simple Field Extensions}

    \(f(x) \in K\) irreducible over K \(\iff K[x]/(f(x))\) is a field (for
    \(f(x) \neq 0\)). Furthermore for \(m(x) \in K[x]\) monic and irreducible
    polynomial:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \(K_{m} = K[x] / (m(x))\) is a field extension of K
      \item For a map \(\pi : K[x] \to K_{m}\) and \(\theta = \pi(x)\). Then
            \(\theta\) has minimal polynomial \(m(x)\) and \(K_{m} =
            K(\theta)\)
    \end{itemize}
    This \(K_{m}\) field extension is the minimal field containg K and the root
    of \(m(x)\).

    For two field extensions \(L_{1} / K\) and \(L_{2} / K\) and \(\varphi:
    L_{1} \to L_{2}\) a field homomorphism, then \(\varphi\) is called a
    \textbf{K-homomorphism} if \(\forall a \in K \; \varphi(a) = a\). It can
    be said that \(\varphi\) \textbf{fixes} K. If it is an isomorphism of fields
    then it is called \textbf{K-isomorphism}. (Also K-automorphism is its a
    K-isomorphism and \(L_{1} = L_{2}\), s.t.\ complex conjugation)

    Take \(K_{m} / K\) with \(\pi\) and \(\theta\) as above, then for \(L / K\)
    with \(\theta' \in L\) satisfying \(m(\theta') = 0\), \(K_{L}(\theta')\) is
    the minimal subfield of L containg K and \(\theta'\), there exists an
    unique K-isomorphism \(\varphi: K_{m} \to K_{L}(\theta')\) s.t.\
    \(\varphi(\theta) = \theta'\).

    This is somewhat easier to denote if \(\theta\) is \textbf{transcendental}.
    In such cases there is a unique K-isomorphism \(\varphi: K(t) \to
    K(\theta)\) s.t.\ \(\varphi(t) = \theta\).

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Some Interesting Simple Extensions}

    \(F_{9} \neq \mathbb{Z} / 9\) is defined as \(\mathbb{Z} / 3 (\theta)
    = F_{3}(\theta) = F_{3} / (x^{2} - 2) = F_{9}\) where \(\theta^{2} = 2\).
    This is actually the same as \(F_{3}(i)\) with i as ususal.

    Similarly \(F_{4} \neq \mathbb{Z} / 4\) is defined as
    \(F_{4} = F_{2} / (x^{2} + x + 1) = F_{2}(\theta)\) for \(\theta^{2} =
    \theta + 1\).

    For any q power of a prime, there exists \(F_{q}\) (unique up to
    isomorphism) with q elements. These fields are called \textbf{Galois
      fields}. \textit{More next term}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Degrees of Field Extensions}

    For an arbitrary field extension \(L / K\) L is a vector space over K. \\
    \textit{This construction essentially removes multiplication for elements
      of L outside of K. This can actually be very useful}.

    The degree of \(L / K\) is the dimention of L over K (size of the basis)
    and is denoted as \([L : K]\). When \(\theta\) is algebraic over K,
    \([K(\theta) : K] = n\). If \([L : K] < \infty\), then it is finite and
    all elements of L are \textbf{algebraic} over K. This is called an
    \textbf{algebraic extension}. If \(theta = t\) (\textbf{indeterminate}) or
    is \textbf{transcendental}, \([L : K] = \infty\). \\
    \textit{There are infinite field extensions with no transcendental
      elements, which cannot be generated by adjoining finitely many algebraic
      elements}.

    For a tower of extensions \(K \subset M \subset L\), \([L : K] =
    [L : M] \times [M : K]\) and \([L : K] < \infty \Rightarrow [L : M], [M : K]
    < \infty\)
