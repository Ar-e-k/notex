\end{section}

\begin{section}{Groups}

  \begin{subsection}{Group basics}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Definisions}
      A \textbf{group} is a set G and an operation \(\bullet\). It is denoted as
      \((G, \bullet)\). A \textbf{group} has to
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Be \textbf{closed}
        \item Be \textbf{associative} \(\forall a,b,c \in G\)
        \item Contain \textbf{identity}, usually denoted as \(i \in G\)
        \item All \(g \in G\) must contain an \textbf{inverse}, denoted as \(g^{-1}\)
      \end{itemize}
      A \textbf{group} is called \textbf{abelian} if \(\bullet\) is \textbf{commutative}
      \(\forall g, h \in G\).

      For simplisitys sake a \textbf{group} \((G, \bullet)\) will be denoted as just G
      if the operation is obvious.

      A \textbf{group} \((G, \bullet)\) is called \textbf{finite} if the set G is finite.
      In such case the order of G is denoted at \(\#G\) and is the size of the set G.

      Two elements \(g, g'\) where \(g \neq g'\) are called \textbf{conjugate} in G
      if \(\exists h \in G \) s.t. \(hgh^{-1} = g'\).
    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Order}
      The \textbf{order} of an element \(g \in G\) is defined as the smallest
      integer r s.t. \(g^{r} = e\), where e is the \textbf{identity} in G.
      If such r does not exists, the order of g is \(\infty\).
      This is denoted as \(ord(g)\).
    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Cyclic groups}
      If a group can be generated by one element, \(G = \langle g \rangle\),
      it is called a \textbf{cyclc group}.

      \emph{Any \textbf{cyclic} groups are always \textbf{abelian}} \\
      \emph{If \#G is prime G is a \textbf{cyclic}}
    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Permutation groups}

      Permutation group \((G, \bullet)\), denoted as \(S_{n}\), is a set
      \(G = \{ 1, 2 \dots n \}\) and \(\bullet\) a bijection.
      For a permutation group \(\#S_{n} = n!\). \\
      A cycle of length 2 is called a \textbf{transposition}. Any \textbf{conjugate}
      of a \textbf{transposition} is also a \textbf{transposition}. \\
      Any \(g \in S_{n}\) can be described as a product of \textbf{transpositions}.

      \emph{How many k-cycles in \(S_{n}\) \[\frac{n!}{k(n-k+1)!}\]}

    \end{subsubsection}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Subgroups}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Basics}
      For a given \textbf{group} \((G, \bullet)\) \((H, \bullet)\) is a \textbf{subgroup}
      if \(H \subset G\), \(H \neq \emptyset\), H is \textbf{closed} under \(\bullet\)
      and \(\forall g \in H \; \exists g^{-1}\) (\textbf{inverses}). \textbf{Identity}
      is guarenteed by \textbf{inverses} and \textbf{closure} and \textbf{associativity}
      is inhereted from \(G, \bullet\). This is denoted as \((H, \bullet) < (G, \bullet)\) \\
      A \textbf{subgroup} is called \textbf{proper} if \(H \neq \{{} e \}{}\) and
      \(H \neq G\).

      \emph{For a \textbf{finite group} \((G, \bullet)\) every \textbf{subgroup}
        \(H < G\) follows \(\#H|\#G\).}
    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Normal}
      A \textbf{subgroup} is called \textbf{normal} if the \textbf{left} and
      \textbf{right cosets} are identical for any \(g \in G\), \(gH = Hg\).
      This is denoted as \(H \triangleleft G\). Alternatively is can be denoted as
      \[ghg^{-1} \in H \;\; \forall g \in G \; \forall h \in H \;\;
        or \;\; gHg^{-1} \subset H \;\; \forall g \in G\]

      H is a normal \textbf{subgroup} of G iff H is a union of \textbf{conjugency classe}
      of G
    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Generators}
      A \textbf{subgroup} H of G is said to be \textbf{generated} by \(g \in G\),
      denoted \(\langle g \rangle\), if \(H = \{ g^{n} \; | \; \forall n \in \mathbb{Z} \}\). \\
      More generally for every subset of G a subgroup generated by all elements
      of this subset can be defined (this idea is very similar to baisis for a
      vectorspace).
    \end{subsubsection}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Cosets}
    \textbf{Left coset} of g with respect to H in G is defined for \(H < G\)
    and \(g \in G\) as \(g \bullet H = \{{} g \bullet h \; | \; \forall h \in H \}{}\).
    A \textbf{left coset} can be construct for any \(g \in G\). \\
    Similarly a \textbf{right coset} of g is defined as
    \(H \bullet g = \{{} h \bullet g \; | \; \forall h \in H \}{}\). \\
    Properies of different \textbf{cosets} with respect to H in G:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item All \textbf{same cosets} have the same \textbf{cardinality}
      \item Two \textbf{same cosets} are either \textbf{disjoint} or \textbf{identical}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{subsection}

\end{section}

\begin{section}{Rings}

  This section will touch on \textbf{rings} as well as other number structures
  such as \textbf{fields}.

  \begin{subsection}{Ring Definision}

    A \textbf{ring} is a set together with two operation, denoted as \(+, \cdot\).
    A group made by \(R, +\) has to be \textbf{abelian}. For \(\cdot\) R has to
    \begin{itemize}
      \item contain \textbf{identity}
      \item be \textbf{associative}
      \item be \textbf{distributive} together with \(+\), meaning
            for \(x, y, z \in R \; x \cdot (y + z) = x \cdot y + x \cdot z\) and
            for \(x, y, z \in R \; (y + z) \cdot x = y \cdot x + z \cdot x\)
      \item \textbf{closure}
    \end{itemize}

    Identities for \(+\) and \(\cdot\) are usually represented as 0 and 1.

    For a ring \(a \cdot b\) can be writen as \(ab\).

    By \textbf{Chinese Remainder Theorem},
    \(\mathbb{Z}/(n_{1}n_{2} \dots n_{m}) \approxeq \mathbb{Z}/n_{1} \times
    \mathbb{Z}/n_{2} \times \dots \times \mathbb{Z}/n_{m}\) for
    \(\gcd(n_{1}, n_{2}, n_{m}) = 1\).

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Subring}

    A \textbf{subring} is a smaller ring with the same operations as its
    parrent ring. \textbf{Subring} is required to contain both \textbf{identites}.
    It also has to be \textbf{closed} under both operation and \textbf{inverses}
    of \(+\) have to exist in it.

    \emph{The ring itself is always its own subring}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Fields}
    A \textbf{field} is a stricter version of a \textbf{ring}. For R to be a
    \textbf{field} R has to be \textbf{ring} as well as
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{commutative} for \(\cdot\)
            (already commutative for \(+\) to be a ring)
      \item \(1 \neq 0 \in R\)
      \item \(\forall a \in R \; a \neq 0 \; \exists b \; s.t. \; a \cdot b = 1\)
            meaning all nonzero elements have inverses for \(/cdot\)
    \end{itemize}

    If F a \textbf{field} then for \(a, b \in F \; ab = 0 \iff a = 0 \; or \; b = 0\).

    \(\mathbb{Z}/n\) is a field \(\iff n\) is prime

    \begin{subsubsection}{Polynomial Fields}

      A polynomial field is defined as
      \(f(x) = a_{0}x^{0} + a_{1}x^{1} + \dots + a_{n}x^{n} \in F[x]\) \\
      \(\deg(f)\) is the biggest power of x in \(f(x)\). If \(f(x) = 0\) then
      \(\deg(f) = -\inf\) \\
      Then for \(f(x), g(x) \in F[x]\)
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \(\deg{fg} = \deg(f) + \deg{g}\)
        \item \(\deg(f + g) \leq \max\{ \deg(f), \deg(g) \}\)
        \item if \(\deg(f) \neq \deg(g)\) then \(\deg(f + g) = \max\{ \deg(f), \deg(g) \}\)
      \end{itemize}

      For \(f(x), g(x) \in F[x]\) with \(g(x) \neq 0\) then \(\exists q(x), r(x) \in F[x]\)
      with \(\deg(r) < \deg(g)\) s.t. \(f(x) = q(x)g(x) + r(x)\).

      For F a field and \(f(x) \in F[x]\) irreducable. Then \(F[x]/(f(x))\) is a field
      and a \textbf{vectorspace} over F with a basis \(1, x, \dots , x^{n - 1}\)
      with \(n = \deg(f(x))\).

    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Special}

      For any prime \(p \in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(n \in \mathbb{N}\)
      \(\exists f(x) \in (\mathbb{Z} / p)[x]\) where \(\deg(f(x)) = n\).
      This produces a field \((\mathbb{Z} / p)[x] / (f(x))\) with \(p^{n}\)
      elements. Any two such fields (with the same amount of elemnts) are \textbf{isomophic}
      so they can all be denoted as \(\mathbb{F}_{p^{n}}\).

    \end{subsubsection}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Integral Domain}

    If a  \textbf{ring} R is \textbf{commutative} for \(\cdot\), R has at least
    two elements (\(0 \neq 1 \in R\)) and R has no zero devisors, meaing
    \(\forall a, b \in R \; ab = 0 \iff a = 0 \; or \; b = 0\).

    This is very similar to a \textbf{field} but all elements \textbf{do not}
    require to have \textbf{inverses}. \\
    \emph{Any \textbf{subring} of a \textbf{field} is \textbf{integral domain}}.

    \(\mathbb{Z}/n\) is an integral domain iff \(\mathbb{Z}/n\) is a \textbf{field}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Unique Factorisation Domain}

    Prime elements are not the same as irreducable elements due to lack of unique
    factorisation. \\
    For R to be a \textbf{UFD}, it has to be an \textbf{integral domain} and
    every element \(\in R, \; \not \in R^{x}\) can be writen \textbf{unique} up
    to unit multiplication. This means every element can be factorised in terms
    of primes.

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Units}

    For a ring R, a is called a \textbf{unit} in R if \(\exists b \in R\) s.t.
    \(ab = ba = 1\). This is the same as saying a is a \textbf{unit} if a is
    \textbf{invertable}, or \(a^{-1} \in R\). The \textbf{inverse} has to be
    unique in R. \\
    The set of all \textbf{units} in R is denoted as \(R^{x}\). This set always
    forms a \textbf{group} \((R^{x}, \cdot)\).

    \begin{subsubsection}{Units in some example rings}
      In a ring \(\mathbb{Z} / n\) a is a \textbf{unit} \(\iff \gcd(a, n) = 1\)
    \end{subsubsection}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Euclidean Algorithm and GCD}

    Note: This is also explained in my \textsc{Elementary Number Theory} notes.

    Take \(a, b \in R\), then a divides b, writen as \(a|b\) if \(\exists r \in R\)
    s.t. \(b = ra\). Then the gcd of \(a, b \in R\), writen \(\gcd(a, b) = d \in R\) if
    \(d|a \; and \; d|b\) and if \(e \in R \; e|a \; and \; e|b\) then \(e|d\).
    This can be used to show the gcd does not exist.\\
    \emph{gcd in a \textbf{ring} is not unique as there is no notion of greater or smaller} \\
    \emph{there are rings where gcd of two numbers \textbf{does not} exist} \\

    \emph{Take an integral domain (or field) R. For \(a, b \in R\) assume \(\gcd(a, b) = d\).
      Then \(\gcd(a, b) = ud \; \forall u \in R^{x}\). In words any gcds differ
      by units only.}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Factorisation in (Polynomial) Rings}

    Most fields do not have the properties of \(\mathbb{Z}\), namely that every
    element can be factorised into primes. Similar holds in polynomial ring \(F[x]\)
    and more generally the class of rings in which it holds is called
    \textbf{unique factorisation domains}.

    \emph{Factorising units is not considered \textbf{proper} factorisation}

    An element r in a commutative ring R is called \textbf{irreducable} if
    \begin{itemize}
      \item r is not a unit
      \item if \(r = ab\) then \(a \in R^{x}\) or \(b \in R^{x}\)
    \end{itemize}

    \emph{In \(\mathbb{Z}\) the irreducable elements are the same as \textbf{primes}}

    In general a \textbf{prime} elements are not always the same as
    \textbf{ireducable} elements. An element x is prime if
    \begin{itemize}
      \item it is non-zero and not a unit
      \item \(x | ab\) for \(a, b \in R\) then \(x | a \; or \; x | b\)
    \end{itemize}
    If an element is \textbf{prime} in a integral domain, it is \textbf{ireducable}.

    For the field \(F[x]\) and \(f(x) \in F[x]\) then
    \begin{itemize}
      \item if \(\deg(f) = 1\) it is irreducable
      \item if \(\deg(f) \in \{ 2, 3 \}\) it is irreducable if it has no roots
            in F, no a s.t. \(f(a) = 0\) and \(a \in F\)\
      \item if \(\deg(f) = 4\) it is irreducable if it has no roots in F
            and there are no \(g(x), h(x) \in F[x], a \in F\) and \(\deg(g), \deg(h) = 2\)
            s.t. \(ag(x)h(x) = f(x)\)
    \end{itemize}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Ring Homomorphism}

    For rings R, S \(f R \to S\) is called a \textbf{Homomorphism} if for
    \(a, b \in R\):
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \(f(1) = 1\), preservs multiplicative identity
      \item \(f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b)\), additive
      \item \(f(ab) = f(a)f(b)\), multiplicative
    \end{itemize}

    This implies
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \(f(0) = 0\), preserves additave identity
      \item \(f(-a) = -f(a)\), preserves inverses
    \end{itemize}

    A \textbf{homomorphism} f is \textbf{injective} iff \(\ker(f) = 0\)

    Kernal of f, denoted \(\ker(f)\), is all \(r \in R\) s.t. \(f(r) = 0\). It is
    closed under addition and for \(r \in R\) and \(x \in \ker(f)\) \(rx \in \ker(f)\).
    This is an example of an \textbf{ideal} of R.

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Ring Products}

    A \textbf{direct product} of R and S, denoted \(R \times S\), is a Cartesian
    product of them (all pairs \((r, s) \forall r \in R, s \in S\)). Their
    binary operations are the same as the original per element.

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Ideals}

    An ideal I of a ring R is a subset of R and it is closed under addition as
    well as \(\forall r \in R\) and any \(x \in I\) \(xr \in I\) and \(rx \in I\).
    A left and right ideal have the same definisions but it only works for left
    or right multiplication. \\
    \emph{An ideal is almost a subring but it usually \textbf{does not} contain
      the identity} \\
    If an ideal is generated by one element it is called \textbf{principal}. \\
    \emph{Any ideal generated by (a, b) is also generated by \(\gcd(a, b)\)}

    For ring R and ideal I, for any \(x \in R\) coset of I generated by x is
    defined to be the set \(x + I := \{x + r : \forall r \in I \} \subset R\). Two such
    cosets are either \textbf{disjoint} or equal.

    \begin{subsubsection}{Quotient Ring}

      A \textbf{quotient} ring, denoted \(R/I\), is defined to be the set of
      all distinct cosets of R by I. One example of such is \(\mathbb{Z}/n\) for
      any number n. \\
      \emph{A quotient ring is verifiably a valid ring} \\
      \emph{There is always a \textbf{homomorphism} from the original ring to
      the quotient ring} \\
      Some properties of them
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \((x + I) + (y + I) := (x + y) + I\)
        \item \((x + I)(y + I) := xy + I\)
        \item If R commutative, so is \(R/I\)
      \end{itemize}

    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{First Isomorphic Theorem}

      Whenether there exists a homomorphism exists, an isomophism can be found
      between a quotient and an image. For \(\varphi_{1}: R \to S\) homomorphism
      \(\exists \varphi_{2}:R/Ker(\varphi_{1}) \to Im(\varphi_{1})\) where \(\varphi_{2}\) is
      an isomophism, \(R/Ker(\varphi_{1}) \approxeq Im(\varphi_{1})\).

    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Prime Ideals}

      An ideal is said to be prime if \(I \neq R\) and for \(ab \in I\) either
      \(a \in I\) or \(b \in I\). If \(x \in R\) then ideal \((x)\) is prime.
      This also works the other way if the ideal is non zero and \textbf{principal}.
      The ideal generated by \((0)\) is prime iff R is an \textbf{integral domain}.
      If an ideal is \textbf{maximal}, it also has to be \textbf{prime}.\\
      \emph{I is only prime if \(R/I\) is an \textbf{integral domain}}

    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Maximal Ideal}

      An ideal is called maximal if \(I \neq R\) and no other ideal contains I. \\
      \emph{I is maximal only f \(R/I\) is a field} For R a PID and \(a \in R\)
      with a \textbf{ireducable} then \((a)\) is a a principal and maximal idea.


    \end{subsubsection}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Principal Ideal Domain}

    An \textbf{integral domain} with where all ideals are \textbf{principal}
    is called a \textbf{principal integral domain}. All numbers have a \textbf{gcd}
    in any PID.\\
    \emph{Any PID is a UFD} \\

    Some examples of PIDs
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \(\mathbb{Z}\)
      \item \(F[x]\) for any F a \textbf{field}
    \end{itemize}

    For R a PID and \(a, b \in R\) coprime \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\). Any
    \(\gcd(x, y)\) is a unit.

    By \textbf{Chinese Remainder Theorem},
    \(\varphi: \mathbb{Z}/(n_{1}n_{2} \dots n_{m}) \to \mathbb{Z}/n_{1} \times
    \mathbb{Z}/n_{2} \times \dots \times \mathbb{Z}/n_{m}\) for
    \(\gcd(n_{1}, n_{2}, n_{m}) = 1\). Then \(\varphi\) is an \textbf{isomophism}.
