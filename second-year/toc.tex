\begin{section}{Models of Computation}

  \begin{subsection}{DFAs}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Basics}

      A \textbf{Deterministic Finite-State Automaton} is a 5-tuple
      \((\mathcal{Q}, \sum, \delta, q_{0}, F)\) where
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item \(\mathcal{Q}\) is a finite set of states
        \item \(\sum\) is a finite alphabet
        \item \(\delta: \mathcal{Q} \times \sum \to \mathcal{Q}\) is the
              transition function
        \item \(q_{0} \in \mathcal{Q}\) is the start state
        \item \(F \subset \mathcal{Q}\) is the set of accept states
      \end{enumerate}

      \emph{DFAs cannot count}

    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Regular Language and Expression}

      A \textbf{language} is called \textbf{regular} if there exists a DFA which
      recognises it (or an NFA but all NFAs have a corresponding DNF).
      To prove a language is non-regular, assume a DFA that recoginises the
      language exists and then show a contradiction.

      A \textbf{regular expression} R defines a regular language \(\mathscr{L}(R)\).
      RE also defines an exacly a class of regular languages, as \(RE \equiv DFA\).
      REs are defined \textbf{recursively}, meaning from initial RE new REs can
      be obtained following the rules below (over an alphabet \(\sum\))
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \(a \in \sum\)
        \item Empty string
        \item \(R_{1} \cup R_{2}\) with \(R_{1}, R_{2} \in R\)
        \item \(R_{1} \cdot R_{2}\) with \(R_{1}, R_{2} \in R\)
        \item \(R_{1}^{*}\) with \(R_{1} \in R\)
      \end{itemize}

      An example use of a regular language
      \footnote{
        \href{https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs103/cs103.1134/lectures/14/Small14.pdf}
        {Source: Standford University}} \\
      For a alphabet \(\sum = \{ a, ., @ \}\) where a is any letter in the real
      alphabet, a regular expression for an email address can be defined as \\
      \[\color{cyan} aa* \color{violet} (.aa*)* \color{gray} @
        \color{green} aa*.aa* \color{blue} (.aa*)*\]
      This represents all the possible emails, with \(* \in [0, \infty)\) begin
      the amount of repetes of a regular expression. Example emails with
      colouring \\
      \(\color{cyan} bob \color{gray} @
      \color{green} bob.com \) \\
      \(\color{cyan} bob \color{violet} .bb \color{gray} @
      \color{green} bob.co \color{blue} .un\) \\
      Note \(aa*\) can also be represented as \(a^{+}\) where the difference is
      \(* \in [0, \infty)\) and \(^{+} \in [1, \infty)\).
            
    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Combining Automata}

      Given a language \(\mathscr{L}_{1}\) recognised by
      \(M_{1} = (\mathcal{Q}_{1}, \sum, \delta_{1}, q_{1}, F_{1})\) and
      similarly \(\mathscr{L}_{2}\) recognised by \(M_{2}\), these two machines
      can be combined into M whih would recognise
      \(\mathscr{L}_{1} \cup \mathscr{L}_{2}\). To achive this
      \(M_{1}, M_{2}\) are runned in parralel and the new machine M can be
      defined as \((\mathcal{Q}, \sum, \delta, q_{0}, F)\) where
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \(\mathcal{Q} = \mathcal{Q}_{1} \times \mathcal{Q}_{2}\)
        \item \(\delta((s, u), a) = (\delta(s, a), \delta(u, a))\) for
              \(s \in \mathcal{Q}_{1}, u \in \mathcal{Q}_{2}, a \in \sum\)
        \item \(q_{0} = (q_{1}, q_{2})\)
        \item \(F = \{ (s, u) \in Q | s \in F_{1} \lor u \in F_{2} \}\)
      \end{itemize}

      The resultant machine is non-deterministic, a NFA.\

    \end{subsubsection}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{NFAs}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Basics}

      A Non-Deterministic Finite-State Autonoma is a 5-tuple similar to
      \textbf{DFA}. The only difference is \(\delta: \mathcal{Q} \times
      (\sum \cup \{ \epsilon \}) \to \mathscr{P}(\mathcal{Q})\) where
      \(\epsilon\) is an empty string \(\notin \sum\).

      M accepts a word w if \(\exists r_{0}, \dots , r_{n}\) s.t.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \(r_{0} = q_{0}\)
        \item
        \(r_{i + 1} \in \delta(r_{i}, w_{i + 1}) \; \forall i \in [0, n - 1]\)
        \item \(r_{n} \in F\)
      \end{itemize}

      \emph{There is no unique path an NFA must take, but at least one path has
        to accept} \\
      \emph{Every NFA has an equivalent DFA}. This means a language is regular
      iff some NFA recognises it.
    
    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Generalised NFA}

      A NFA with a single start state, single accept state with no edgs leaving
      it and every edge labeled with a regular expression.

    \end{subsubsection}
  
  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Pumping Lemma}

    For every regular language \(\mathscr{L} \; \exists p\) s.t.\
    \(\forall w \in \mathscr{L}\) where \(len(w) \geq p \;
    \exists x, y, z\) with \(w = xyz\) and
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \(xy^{i}z \in \mathscr{L} \; \forall i \in \mathbb{N}\)
      \item \(y \neq \epsilon\)
      \item \(len(xy) \leq p\)
    \end{itemize}
    \emph{This can be very useful to prove a language is not regular} such as:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \(\{ 0^{n}1^{n} | n \in \mathbb{N} \}\)
      \item \(\{ w | amt(w_{0}) = amt(w_{1})\}\) amt is the amount of n in \(w_{n}\)
      \item \(\{ ww | w\in \{ 0, 1 \}* \}\)
      \item Palindroms over \(\{ 0, 1 \}\)
      \item \(\{ 1^{n^{2}} | n \in \mathbb{N} \}\)
      \item \(\{ 0^{i} 1^{j} | i > j \geq 0 \}\)
    \end{itemize}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{\(\omega-\)regular Language}

    For A and B \(\omega-regular\) language \(R^{\omega}\) and C a regular
    language
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \(A \cup B \in R^{\omega}\)
      \item \(AC \in R^{\omega}\)
      \item \(C^{\omega}\) which is \(a_{1}a_{2} \dots | a_{i} \in C^{\omega}\)
      is an infite sequence of words from C and \(\epsilon \notin C^{\omega}\)
    \end{itemize}
    A language is only \(\omega-regular\) if there is a non-deterministic
    B\"uchi Automata which recognises it. This class of languages is closed
    under intersection and complementation.

    Limit of a regular language A, denoted lim A, is
    \{ \(a \in \sum^{\omega} |\) a has infinitely many prefixes in A \}. \\
    An \(\omega-language\) is a limit of a regular language iff there is a
    deterministic B\"uchi Automata recognises it.

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{B\"uchi Automata}

    An infnitite string is accepted if the accpetance state is visited
    \textbf{infinitely} often.

    \emph{Some non deterministic BAs cannot be made deterministic}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Linear Temporal Logic}

    A formula in LTL is deffined by
    \[\phi := true | a | \phi_{1} \land \phi_{2} | \lnot \phi | \circ \phi | \phi_{1} \cup \phi_{2}\]
    where \(\phi\) is an atomic propposition (AP), \(\circ\) means next and \(\cup\) means until. \\
    There also exists
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \(\lozenge a\) is true \(\cup a\)
      \item \(\square a\) is \(\lnot \lozenge \lnot a\)
    \end{itemize}

    The set of all atomic propositions is dentoted as \(2^{AP}\).

    \begin{subsubsection}{Satisfaction Relation}
      (Confusing stuff) \\
      Satisfaction relation, denoted as \(\models\), is defined recursively as for
      an infinite sequence of words \(\sigma \in (2^{AP})^{\omega}\)
      \(\sigma = A_{0}A_{1} \dots\) and formulas
      \(\phi, \phi_{1}, \phi_{2}\)
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \(\sigma \models true\)
        \item \(\sigma \models a\) iff \(a \in A_{0}\)
        \item \(\sigma \models \phi_{1} \land \phi_{2}\) iff
        \(\sigma \models \phi_{1}\) or \(\sigma \models \phi_{2}\)
        \item \(\sigma \models \lnot \phi\) iff \(\sigma \not\models \phi\)
        \item \(\sigma \models \circ \phi\) iff \(A_{1} \dots \models \phi\)
        \item \(\sigma \models \phi_{1} \cup \phi_{2}\) iff
        \(\exists i > j \geq 0\) s.t.\ \(A_{i} \dots \models \phi_{2}\) and
        \(A_{j} \dots \phi_{1}\).
      \end{itemize}
      The set of all words that satisfy a formla \(\phi\) is called
      \(Words(\phi)\).

    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Transition System}

      A transition system TS consists of
      \begin{itemize}
        \item A finite set of states S
        \item A transition relation \(\to : S \times S\) with for every
        \(s_{1} \in S \; \exists s_{2} \in S\) s.t.\ \(s_{1} \to s_{2}\)
        \item A set of inital states \(I \subset S\)
        \item A finite set of atomic propositions AP
        \item A labelling \(L: S \to 2^{AP}\)
      \end{itemize}

      A run of TS is an infinite sequene of states \(s_{0} \to s_{1} \to \dots\)
      where \(s_{0} \in I\). This produces an \textbf{infinite trace}
      \(\sigma \in (2^{AP})^{\omega}\). The set of all possible traces of TS ic
      called \textbf{Traces(TS)}. \\
      TS satisfies \(\phi\), \(TS \models \phi\) if
      \(Traces(TS) \subset Words(\phi)\), meaning each trace t satisfies a
      formula \(\phi\).\ \emph{It is possible for \(TS \not \models \phi\) and
      \(TS \not \models \lnot \phi\)}

    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Converting to B\"uchi Automata}

      For a TS \(\tau\) and an LTL formula \(\phi\) both over the same set of
      atomic propositions AP.\ A BA can be used to determine if
      \(\tau \models \phi\). This is identical to checking \(Traces(\tau) \subset
      Words(\phi)\) as well as \(Traces(\tau) \cap Words(\lnot \tau) = \emptyset\).


    \end{subsubsection}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{ComputationTree Logic}

    A \textbf{state-formula} is defined as
    \[\phi := true | a | \phi_{1} \land \phi_{2} | \lnot \phi | A \varphi | E \varphi\]
    where a is an atomic propositions, \(\phi_{1}, \phi_{2}\) are also
    state-formulas and \(\varphi\) is a \textbf{path-formula}. This is defined as
    \[\varphi := X \phi | G \phi | F \phi | \phi_{1} U \phi_{2} | \phi_{1} W \phi_{2}\]
    with the letters definded as
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A is for all
      \item E is there exists
      \item X is next
      \item G is always (global)
      \item F is eventually (finaly)
      \item U is until
      \item W is week until / unless (the condition may nevery happen)
    \end{itemize}
    where A and E are \textbf{quantifiers over paths} and the rest are
    \textbf{path-specific quantifiers}. These come in pairs, over path one followed
    by a specific one.

    \begin{subsubsection}{Satisfaction Relation}

      This is defined similarly to the one for LTL.\ For a set of atomic propositions
      AP, a transition system \(TS = (S, \to, I, AP, L)\) and a state \(s \in S\)
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \(s \models true\)
        \item \(s \models a\) iff \(a \in L(S)\)
        \item \(s \models \phi_{1} \land \phi_{2}\) iff
        \(s \models \phi_{1}\) or \(s \models \phi_{2}\)
        \item \(s \models \lnot \phi\) iff \(\sigma \not\models \phi\)
        \item \(s \models A \varphi\) iff \(\pi \models \varphi \;
              \forall \pi \in Paths(s)\)
        \item \(s \models E \varphi\) iff \(\exists \pi \in Paths(s)\)
              s.t.\ \(\pi \models \varphi\)
      \end{itemize}

      Also for a path \(\pi = \pi_{0}, p_{1} \dots\) where all \(\pi_{i} \in S\)
      \(\pi \models X \phi \iff \pi_{1} \models \phi\) and \\
      \(\pi \models \phi_{1} U \phi_{2} \iff \exists i > j \geq 0\) s.t
      \(\pi_{i} \models phi_{2}\) and \(\pi_{j} \models \phi_{1}\).

    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Comparison to LTL}

      Any CLT can be converted to a LTL by removing the \textbf{quantifiers over
        paths}. This will always be correct \textbf{if there exists an equivelance}.
      If the resultant formulas are not correct, both the formula in LTL and CLT
      cannot be represented in the opposite system. One such example is AFAGa
      and \(\lozenge \square a\). This means that LTL and CLT are \textbf{incomparable}.

    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{CLT*}

      The \textbf{state-formula} for CLT* is the same as for CLT and the only
      difference in \textbf{path-formula} is the addition of
      \(\phi | \varphi_{1} \land \varphi_{2} | \lnot \varphi\) where
      \(\pi \models \phi \iff \pi_{0} \models \pi\).

    \end{subsubsection}

  \end{subsection}

\end{section}

\begin{section}{Turing Machines}

  \begin{subsection}{Basics}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Basic Turing Machine}

      A \textbf{Turing Machine} (or TM) is a 7-tuple
      \((\mathcal{Q}, \sum, \Gamma, \delta, q_{0}, q_{accept}, q_{reject})\) where
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item \(\mathcal{Q}\) is the set of all possible states
        \item \(\sum\) is the input alphabet, \textit{not containing the \textbf{blank} symbol \(\sqcup\)}
        \item \(\Gamma\) is the tape alphabet satisfying \(\sum \subset \Gamma\) and \(\sqcup \in \Gamma\)
        \item \(\delta: \mathcal{Q} \times \Gamma \to \mathcal{Q} \times \Gamma \times \{{} L, R \}{}\)
              is the transition function. L means the head moves left and R right.
        \item \(q_{0} \in \mathcal{Q}\) is the start state
        \item \(q_{accept} \in \mathcal{Q}\) is the accept state
        \item \(q_{reject} \in \mathcal{Q}\) is the reject state
        \item \(q_{accept} \neq q_{reject}\)
      \end{enumerate}

      The Turing machine has infinite memory (tape) to the right. It has a tape head which
      can read, write and nove around in both directions (R and L). The alphabet \(\Gamma\)
      is writen on the tape. \\
      The tape content is always finite, the first \(\sqcup\) empty symbol maps the end of
      the tape's content. The current configuration consists of
      \emph{current state \(\in \mathcal{Q}\), tape content \(\in \Gamma\) and head location on the tape}.
      Accepting or rejecting configuration is when \(q_{accept}\) and \(q_{reject}\)
      are the states in the configuration respectfully.

      If a TM never halts, its time and space complexity are both undefined.

    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Multitape TM}

      A Multitape TM its like an ordinary TM with several tapes and heads.
      \emph{Every Multitape TM has an \textbf{equivelant} single tape TM}.
      The formal difference of the Multitape TM is
      \[\delta: \mathcal{Q} \times \Gamma^{k} \to \mathcal{Q} \times \Gamma^{k} \times \{{} L, R \}{}^{k}\]
      where k is the number of tapes.

      For time complexity, for a multitape TM \(\mathscr{M}_{M}\) and single tape
      TM \(\mathscr{M}_{s}\) \linebreak \(TIME_{\mathscr{M}_{M}} = TIME_{\mathscr{M}_{S}}^{2}\)

    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Non-deterministic TM}

      This is a TM which only accepts an input if there is a computation
      that ends in the accepting configuration.\ \emph{Similarly to Multitape TM
        there is always a regular TM that is \textbf{equivelant}
        to the non-deterministic one}. Proof idea: Consider a tree
      of all possible comutations. Start from the beggining and only accept if
      \textbf{BFS} finds the accepting configuration.\ \textit{Note: DFS would not work}. \\
      Formaly
      \[\delta: \mathcal{Q} \times \Gamma \to \mathscr{P}(\mathcal{Q} \times \Gamma \times \{{} L, R \}{})\]
      where \(\mathscr{P}\) is whatever the fuck it wants to be.
      
    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Univeral Turing Machine}

      Every TM \(\mathscr{M}\) can be encoded as a word over a finite alphabet.
      The encoding of this TM can be denoted as \(\langle \mathscr{M} \rangle\). \\
      The \textbf{Universal Turing Machine} takes a two-part input, them being
      \(\langle \mathscr{M} \rangle\) and a word \textit{w} and simulate
      \textit{w} on \(\mathscr{M}\).

      Any such encodint can also be represented as a \textbf{GÃ¶del number},
      denoted as \([\mathscr{M}]\).

    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Oracle Turing Machine}

      This is a regular Turing Machine \(\mathscr{M}\) except for it has the
      capability of making calls to an oracle for a language A. Such a TM is
      denoted as \(\mathscr{M}^{A}\). This oracles is blackbox, it can instantly
      determine accept or reverse on all words\(\in A\).

    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Some TM properies}

      \textbf{Parameter Theorem} \\
      Let \(\mathscr{M}(x, y)\) be a TM that accepts two inputs. There exists
      another TM which on input \(\langle \mathscr{M} \rangle\) and x produces
      a description of the original TM on x, \(\langle \mathscr{M}_{x} \rangle\)
      s.t.\ \(\forall y \; \mathscr{M}_{x}(y) = \mathscr{M}(x, y)\). \\
      This means every two input TM can be transformed infinite amount of one
      input TMs, one for every specific input. This seems like its somewhat
      similar to group actions, expand later.

      \textbf{Recursion Theorem} \\
      For every TM \(\mathscr{M}(x, y) \exists \mathscr{R}\) (a TM) s.t.\
      \(\forall y \; \mathscr{R}(y) = \mathscr{M}(\langle \mathscr{R} \rangle, y)\). \\
      This theorem is a direct extension of a TM returning its own description
      and means any TM can be modified to do that as well as its primary job.

      \textbf{Encoding TMs} \\
      Any TM \(\mathscr{M}\) can be encoded as a single number, \([\mathscr{M}]\). \\
      Any configuration of this (or any other) TM can also be encodied as a single number,
      denoted [q,i,w] which are state, head position and and tape content, via a
      \textbf{primitive recursive} function \([q, i, w] = C(q, i, w)\).
      Moreover if the given configuration yields a new configuration, the funcion
      \(Step([q, i, w]) = [q', i', w']\) (where q', i', w' is the new configuration)
      is also a \textbf{primitive recursive} function.

    \end{subsubsection}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Language}

    A string \textit{w} is a sequence of configurations \(C_{1}, C_{2}, \dots C_{k}\) such that
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \(C_{1}\) is the configuration
      \item \(C_{i}\) goes to \(C_{i+1}\) for all \(i \in [1, k - 1]\)
    \end{itemize}
    String \textit{w} is \emph{accepted} if \(C_{k}\) is the accepting configuration. \\
    The set of strings accepted by a TM \(\mathscr{M}\) is called the language of \(\mathscr{M}\)
    and denoted as \(L(\mathscr{M})\).

    A language \(\mathscr{L}\) is defined to be \textbf{Turing-Recognisable (or semi-decidable)}
    if there is a TM \(\mathscr{M}\) that recognises it, i.e.\ \(\mathscr{L} = L(\mathscr{M})\).
    So if there \(\mathscr{M}\) accepts all \(\textit{w} \in \mathscr{L}\) then \(\mathscr{L}\)
    is \textbf{Turing-Recognisable}.
    Another way to determin if a language is \textbf{semi-decidable if and only if} its in:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Domain of a \textbf{partially computable} function
      \item Range of a \textbf{computable} function
      \item Range of a \textbf{partially computable} function
    \end{itemize}

    Similarly, a language \(\mathscr{L}\) is called \textbf{Turing-Decidable (or decidable)}
    if it is Turing-Recognisable and all \(\textit{w} \notin \mathscr{L}\) are rejected.
    From this it is visible that \textbf{Turing-Decidable} is a stronger notion than
    \textbf{Turing-Recognisable}.

    \textbf{Important note:} The notion used to be recursiverly enumerable (r.e.)
    and recursive for semi-decidable and decidable. \\
    A language \(\mathscr{L}\) is decidable if \(\mathscr{L}\) is semi-decidable
    and co-\(\mathscr{L}\) is also semi-decidable.

    \textbf{Time complexity} of a decidable language is \(f(x)\) if there exists
    a TM \(\mathscr{M}\) such that \(Time_{\mathscr{M}} = f(x)\)

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Halting Problem}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Normal Halting Problem}

      The \textbf{Halting Problem (H)} is determining whenether any given TM
      accepts any given word. This problem \textbf{\emph{is} Turing-Recognisable}
      but \textbf{\emph{is not} Turing-Decidable}.

      \emph{The \textbf{Halting Problem} is m-complete}.

    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Co-Halting Problem}

      The \textbf{Co-Halting Problem (co-H)} is the opposite of the \textbf{Halting Problem},
      namely determine if a given TM does not accept a given word. This problem
      \textbf{\emph{is not} Turing-Recognisable}.

    \end{subsubsection}

    \emph{\textbf{H} and \textbf{co-H} are \textbf{t-reducable} to each other, but
      neither \textbf{m-reducable} to the other.}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Reducibility}

    \begin{subsubsection}{m-reducibility}

      Let A and B be languages over the same alphabet \(\sum\).
      A is \textbf{many-to-one} reducible to B (writen as \(A \leq B\)) if
      there is a Turing Machine \(\mathscr{M}\) that terminates on every input
      \(u \in \sum^{*}\) and such that \(A=\{{} u \in \sum^{*} | \mathscr{M}(u) \in B\}\).
      This means that \(\sum^{*}\) is semi-decidable by \(\mathscr{M}\). \\
      This is equivelant to saying that checking if \(u \in A\) is no harder
      than checking if \(w \in B\). \\
      Properites of m-reducibility, where \(A \leq B\):
      \begin{itemize}
        \item B is semi-decidable \(\Rightarrow\) A is semi-decidable
        \item B is decidable \(\Rightarrow\) A is decidable
        \item \(A \leq B \land B \leq C \Rightarrow A \leq C\)
      \end{itemize}

      If \(A \leq B \land B \leq A\) then we write \(A \equiv B\), meaning
      A and B are both as dificult to solve.

      A is m-complete is A is at least as hard as any other Turing-Recognisable language.
      If A is m-complete and \(A \leq B\) then B is m complete and \(A \equiv B\).

    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{t-reducibility}

      A language A is \textbf{t-reducible} to a language B if A can be decided
      by the oracle Turing Machine \(\mathscr{M}^{B}\). This is denoted as
      \(A \leq_{t} B\). \\
      Take A and B s.t. \(A \leq_{t} B\) then
      B is decidable \(\Rightarrow\) A is decidable.

    \end{subsubsection}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Functions}

    A \textbf{total function} \(f: \sum \rightarrow \sum\) is \textbf{computable} if
    \(\exists \mathscr{M}\) (a TM) s.t.\ on any input \(x \in \sum\)
    \(\mathscr{M}(x) = f(x)\).

    A \textbf{partial function} \(f: \sum \rightarrow \sum\) is
    \textbf{partially computabl} if \(\exists \mathscr{M}\) (a TM) s.t.
    for any \(x \in dom(f)\) \(\mathscr{M}(x) = f(x)\) and if \(x \notin dom(f)\)
    \(\mathscr{M}\) does not terminate.

    Obtaining a function by \textbf{composition} \\
    Take function \(f(x_{1}, \dots, x_{k})\) and functons
    \(g_{1}(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}), \dots, g_{k}(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n})\).
    Then \(h(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n})\) is obtaitained by \textbf{composition}
    of f and gs if
    \[h(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}) := f(g_{1}(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}), \dots, g_{k}(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}))\]

    Obtaining a function by \textbf{primitive recursion} \\
    Take \(f(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n})\) and \(g(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n+2})\). Then
    \(h(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n + 1})\) is obtaitained by \textbf{primitive recursion}
    of f and g if
    \[h(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}, 0) := f(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n})\]
    \[h(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}, t + 1) := g(t, h, x_{1}, \dots, x_{n})\]

    A function is called \textbf{primitive recursive} if it can be obtaitained
    from an inital function by a finite aplication of
    \textbf{compositions} and \textbf{primitive recursions}

    \textit{The following functions are primitive recursive:
      addition, subtraction, multiplication, integral division
      (quotient and remainder), exponentiation, integral logarithm,
      n-th prime number, i-th digit in base b expansion.}

    \textbf{GÃ¶del Numbers} is also primitive recursive.

    \textbf{Step-Counter} function is defined to be
    \[SC([\mathscr{M}], [w], 0) = [q_{start}, 0, w]\]
    \[SC([\mathscr{M}], [w], t + 1) = Step(SC([\mathscr{M}], [w], t))\]
    on a given TM \(\mathscr{M}\) and word w as well as their encoding.
    This function \textbf{primitive recursive}. \\
    This function can return any configuration of a given TM on any input
    after any amount of steps.

    \begin{subsubsection}{Vertex Cover}

      Vertex cover can be used to solve set cover.

    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Independent Set}

      An independent set of a graph g is a set of vertecies s.t.\ no two

      problem can be made more specific, with k-coloability being a decision
      problem asking can a graph be coloured with at most k colours.

      2-coloability can be reduced to 2-satisfiability.

      the cnf is satisfiable.

      A choice gadged exists \ldots

    \end{subsubsection}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Shortest Path}

    A shortest path between two edges, u and v, in a graph is denoted
    as \(\delta(u, v)\). Each eadge has a weight, so for u, v next to each other
    the weight between u and v is denoted as \(w(u, v)\).
    If there is no path between the edges \(\delta(u, v) = \infty\).
    there can be no possitive cycles in the shortest path.
    If there is a negative cycle in the graph, \(\delta(u, v) = -\infty\), so
    we shall assume there are no negative cycles.

    An algorithm which finds the shortest path between a specific vertex s
    and all other verticies in the graph is a generalisations of
    \textbf{BFS}, where \textbf{BFS} works on graphs
    where all verticies have length 1.
    The output of such a function should be two arrays, denoted as d and \(\pi\)
    where
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \(d(v) = \delta(s, v)\)
      \item \(\pi(v)\) is the predecessor of v
    \end{itemize}
    Dijkstra's algorithm is the algorithm with such outputs, explenation of
    how the algorithm works is ommited here. Dijkstra only works under certain
    relaxation that there are no negative edges.

    Dijkstra has a running time of \(o(v \log(v) + e)\).

    Some properies of shortest path:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item for all edge u, v \(\delta(s, v) \leq \delta(s, u) + w(u, v)\)
      \item any subpath of a shortest path is also a shortest path
      \item for every vertex v, \(d(v \geq s)\)
      \item if \(\delta(s, v) = \infty\) then \(d(v) = \infty\) at every itteration
    \end{itemize}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Network Flow}

    Weight of a directed edge from u to v is called \(c(u, v)\).
    For a network flow we have:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \(g = (v, e)\) is a directed graph
      \item there exists a \emph{source s} and \emph{sink t}
      \item each edge \((u, v) \in e\) has no negative capacity
      \item if \((u, v) \notin e\) we assume the capacity is 0
    \end{itemize}
    We assume that every vertex \(v \in v\) lies between s and t.

    The flow in g is a real-valued function \(f: v \times v \to \mathbb{R}\)
    that satisfies the following properties:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item flow from u to v must not exceed the vertex capacity, meaning
            \(f(u, v) \leq c(u, v) \; \forall u, v \in v\)
      \item flow from u to v is the reverse flow v from u,
            \(f(u, v) = -f(v, u) \; \forall u, v \in v\)
      \item total in is equivelant to total out for all verticies other than s and t
            \(\sum_{v \in v} f(u, v) = 0 \; \forall u \in v/\{{} s, t \}{}\)
    \end{itemize}
    Fhe function \(f(u, v)\) can also be wirten as \(f(u_{1}, u_{2})\) where
    \(u_{1}, u_{2} \subset v\). \\
    Total positive flow entering at v is \(\sum_{u \in v f(u, v) > 0} f(u, v)\). \\
    Total positive flow leaving at v is \(\sum_{u \in v f(v, u) > 0} f(v, u)\). \\
    Total net flow at v is total positive flow \(leaving - entering\). \\
    Flow value is defined as the total flow leaving at source or the total
    flow entering at sink (they are equivelant). \\
    Residual capacity, denoted \(c_{f}(u, v)\) is definied as the avaliable flow
    left on an edge, \(c(u, v) - f(u, v)\). For a network g, residual network denoted as \(g_{f}\)
    is the same graph with all edges replaced with their residual capacity.

    Flow and capacity of a network can be taken at any point in the network.
    To do this we take a ``cut'' the network and deal with all vertecies through
    which the cut goes. Flow is defined as the sum of all flow out of one side, including
    negative while capacity is defined as the sum of all maximum flows. The capacity of any
    cut is an upper bound for the total flow in the network. Such cut can be denoted
    as \((s, t)\) and its flow and capacity can be denoted as \(f(s, t), \; c(s, t)\). \\
    For a network g take w to be the maximum flow. This implies there are no
    augmenting paths in \(g_{f}\) and \(|w| = c(s, t)\) for some cut \(s, t\).

    A network can be maximised in \(o(v^{2} + e)\), which is polynomial time.

    Some applications of network flow:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item dancing party problem
      \item maximum bipartite matching
    \end{itemize}

  \end{subsection}

\end{section}

\begin{section}{Time Complexity}

  Problems refered to as ``fast'' have polynomial time algorithms to solve them.
  This problems can also be refered to as \textbf{tractable}. Otherwise the
  problems are refered to intractable. More formal definisions will be later
  in this section.

  \begin{subsection}{Optimisation Problems}

    All optimisation problems talked about so far had polynomial time algorithm
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Shortest Path between two verticies
      \item MST of a graph, spanning tree in G of a minimum weight
      \item Maximum Flow in a graph
      \item Maximum Matching in a bipartite graph
    \end{itemize}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Decision Problems}

    For decision problems the anwser is simpy Yes or No. Every optimisation
    problem has its decision counterpart. \\
    \emph{An optimisation problem has a polynomial algorithm \textbf{if and only if}
      the corresponding decision problem has a polynomial algorithm.}

    Encoding is important on a decision problem. Numbers should be represented
    efficiently, not in base 1 (whatever the fuck base 1 is). It is also
    important not to add aditional informatino to the encoding.

    For a problem \(\Pi\) and an encoding scheme e with an alphabet \(\sum\)
    \(\mathscr{L}(\Pi, e)\) is defined to be a language of all strings corresponding
    to the anwser yes. This language is said to be \textbf{associated} with \(\Pi\) and e.

    Decision problems can be classified into \textbf{decidable} and \textbf{undecidable}.
    All decidable problems have a set of algorithms that solve it. The decidable
    problems also have a set of TMs that solve them, which is equivelant to
    the set of algorithms.

    This algorithms can be classified by:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Difficulty to construct an algorithm
      \item The length of the shortes possible algorithm
      \item Efficiency of the most efficient algorithm
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{subsubsection}{Satisfiability}

      A logical formula f is said to be \textbf{CNF}, meaning conjuctive normal form, if
      \[f = C_{1} \land C_{2} \land \dots \land C_{m}\]
      where each \(C_{i} \; \forall i \in [1, m]\) is a disjunction of literals
      \[C_{i} = (I_{i1} \lor I_{i2} \lor \dots \lor I_{in})\]
      where each \(I_{ij} \; \forall j \in [1, n]\) is either True or False.

      \textbf{k-CNF} is a \textbf{CNF} where \(n \leq k \; \forall \; C \in \textbf{k-CNF}\)

      The \textbf{CNF} is said to be \textbf{satisfiable} if there exists an
      assigment of literals True and False such that the end result is True.
      Due to how \textbf{CNF}s are defined, at least one literal per clause must be True.

    \end{subsubsection}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Encoding}

    Encoding is a way to represent numbers/strings. As stated above, encoding
    in base 1 is very inefficient.

    For any number n, the length of the encoding of n in base \(b_{0}\) and the
    length of the encoding of n in a different base \(b_{1}\) is related by
    a constant factor.\ \((\forall b_{0}, b_{1} \geq 2)\)

    For any graph G, the length of the encoding of G as a adjacency matrix and
    the length of the encoding of G as a list of edges are related by
    a polynomial factor to the number of verticies.

    \begin{subsubsection}{GÃ¶del Numbers}

      Any string w over an alphabet \(\sum\) can be encoded by a single number,
      denoted as [w]. Similarly any formula \(\phi\) and proof \(\Pi\)
      can also be encoded a number, denoted as \([\phi]\) and \([\Pi]\).

      By considering the \textbf{co-H} and \textbf{H} it can be shown that not
      every true formula is provable. Alternatively this can be achived by a
      \([g]\) where g says that g cannot be proven. The predictate % define later, !!!IMPORTANT
      \textit{\(Proof([\Pi], [\phi])\)} states that \(\Pi\) is a proof of \(\phi\).
      This predictate is \textbf{primitive recursive}.

      It is assumed that \(\phi\) and \(\lnot \phi\) cannot both be proven in a
      system. It is proven that this cannot be proven.
      
    \end{subsubsection}

  \end{subsection}

  \begin{subsection}{Complexity Classes}

    Complexity classes can be same or different for the same problem, depending
    on the encoding method. Numerical encodings of any base do not change the
    complexity class. Other encodings may or may not change the complexity class.
    (Going to be stated in the class subsections). \\
    Any problem in a class called \textbf{complete} if there is a reduction
    to it from every other problem in this class. This means there is no harder
    problem in that class. Analogue with \textbf{m-completness}.

    \textbf{Big open question in Computer Science is whenethr
      \emph{P} is equivelant to \emph{NP}.} This has not been proven
    or disproven up to date. The mostly accepted anwser is that
    \textbf{P} is not equivelant to \textbf{NP} but there no
    proof of that yet.

    \begin{subsubsection}{Problem Reduction}

      A problem X polynomialy reduces to a problem Y if any instance of X can
      be transformed to Y in a polynomial number of steps and solved using
      a polynomial amount of calls to an oracle that solves Y. This is denoted as
      \(X \leq Y\). \\
      Also \(X \leq Y \land Y \leq X \Rightarrow\) X and Y are equivelant.

    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{\textbf{P} Class}

      Polynomial class \textbf{P} is defined to be
      \[\textbf{P} = \cup_{k \geq 0} TIME[n^{k}]\]
      In words \textbf{P} is all algorithms that have a running time
      of a finite polynomial.

      \textbf{P} is a reasonable model of the class of problems which are
      tractable. However some polynomials can be so large that in pracitice the
      problems are not solvable.\ \textit{Note:} Very large coefficiants seem to
      only arrise in artificial problems, for the naturally defnined ones the constants
      are usually not to large.

      Invarient encodings:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Graphs encoded as: list of edges and adjacency matrix
      \end{itemize}

      Class \textbf{P} is said to be \textbf{robust}, meaing it does not
      depend on the exact details of the computation method or the encoding.
      The most direct way to show a problem is in \textbf{P} is to find
      a polynomial time algorithm. Problems can also be shown to be in \textbf{P}
      by simply proving a polynomial time algorithm must exist.
      Another way to show a problem is in \textbf{P} is to use a reduction.
      For this to work the reduction has to also be in \textbf{P}.

      Some algorithms in \textbf{P}:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item 2-satisfiability
        \item 2-coloability
        \item Knotlessness (not explenation/definision)
        \item Linear Programming
        \item Composite Number --- is a number (not) prime
      \end{itemize}

    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{\textbf{NP} Class}

      This is a class of problems which do not have \textit{(up to date)}
      a polynomial time algorithm but do have a polynomial time verifier.

      Another way to define the \textbf{NP} class is through
      non-deterministic TMs. The non-deterministic time complexity
      of a decidable language \(\mathscr{L} = O(f)\) if there exists a NTM
      \(\mathscr{M}\) which decides \(\mathscr{L}\) and \(NTime_{\mathscr{M}} = O(f)\). \\
      Lastly a non-deterministic time complexity NTIME[f] is defined similarly to
      regular time complexity class. \\
      This results in the alternative definision of \textbf{NP} being
      \[\textbf{NP} = \cup_{k \geq 0} NTIME[n^{k}]\]
      and \textbf{NP} can be expanded as non-deterministic polynomial-time. \\
      It can be proven that both of these definisions of \textbf{NP} are equivelant.

      Some algorithms in \textbf{NP}, items bold if also complete:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Satisfiability}
        \item \textbf{Subgraph Isomorphism}
        \item \textbf{Vertex Cover}
        \item \textbf{Clique}
        \item k-Colourability \textbf{probably, 3-Colourability is NP-comp}
        \item \textbf{Hamiltonian Cycle}
        \item \textbf{Traveling Salesman Problem}
        \item \textbf{Hitting Set}
        \item \textbf{Subset Sum} --- is there a subset adding up to t
      \end{itemize}

      Some algorithms which are probably not in \textbf{NP}:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item No Hamiltonian Cycle
        \item Checkers --- is there a winning position
      \end{itemize}

    \begin{subsubsection}{\textbf{NP}-Complete Sub Class}

      By definision of \textbf{completness} this are the hardest problems in \textbf{NP}.
      All \textbf{NP}-Complete problems are by definision equivelant.
      To show a problem is in this class it must be shown that every problem in
      the \textbf{NP} reduces to that problem. Although this is very hard, once there
      exists one problem in this class, a new problem X can be shown to be \textbf{complete}
      by simply showing that a problem already in \textbf{NP}-Complete (Y) reduces to X,
      \(Y \leq X\).
      It also must be shown that the problem in question is in \textbf{NP}. \\
      \emph{This first \textbf{NP}-complete problem is \textbf{Satisfiability}.} \\
      This also means \(\textbf{P} = \textbf{NP} \iff Satisfiability \in \textbf{P}\).

      Some ways for a problem X and \(Y \in \textbf{NP}-Complete\) to show that
      \(Y \leq X\):
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Show that Y is a subproblem of X
        \item Show that every basic instance of Y can be manipulated to an instance of X
        \item Show that instances of X can be used to design compnents that can encode Y
      \end{itemize}

      Some algorithms in \textbf{NP}-complete are listed with the other
      \textbf{NP} problems.

    \begin{subsubsection}{\textbf{NP}-Intermidiate Sub Class}

      This only exists if \(\textbf{P} \neq \textbf{NP}\).
      If it exists, it consists infinite amount of problems.

      \textbf{NP}-intermidiate sublass can also be defnined as a class of
      problems which are neither in \textbf{P} or \textbf{NP}-complete.
      This two definisions can be used to deduce that
      \(\textbf{NP}-intermidiate \neq \emptyset \iff \textbf{P} \neq \textbf{NP}\).

      Currently the best candidate for \textbf{NP}-intermidiate is Graph Isomorphism.

    \end{subsubsection}

    \begin{subsubsection}{\textbf{NP}-Hard Sub Class}

      For a given problem X and a problem \(Y \in \textbf{NP}-Complete\) if
      \(Y \leq X\) but \(X \notin \textbf{NP}\) then \(X \in \textbf{NP}-Hard\)

  \begin{subsection}{Checkable Problems}

    Every yes-instane hard problem has a short and easly checkable \textbf{certificate}

    An \textbf{acceptor} machine V which acts on all inputs is called a \textbf{verifier}
    for a language \(\mathscr{L}\) if
    \begin{center}
      \(\mathscr{L} = \) \{{} w | V accept ``w; c'' for some string c \}{}
    \end{center}
    where c is called a \textbf{certificate (or witness)} for w. The verifier is
    polynomial time if for any \(w \in \mathscr{L}\) there exists a certificate
    c with c is \(O(p(n))\) where p a polynomial function.
